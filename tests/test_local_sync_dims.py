"""Regression test for round-32 local_sync missing dimensions bug.

After round-30 made image_loader.load() return source_w/source_h and
the pipeline / run_pipeline / upsert_all updated to pass them through
to build_payload, local_sync.py was missed — its ingest path still
called build_payload(path, shard, model, rev, collection) without
width/height. Every photo touched by local_sync ended up with
width=null, height=null in the qdrant payload, and the photo page
showed "—" for dimensions.

These tests verify that local_sync's ingest path passes through the
loader-captured source dimensions.
