"""
tests/test_no_to_thread_on_hot_paths.py — C1 regression gate.

Per the plan §C1: "A grep-based test fails if [an `asyncio.to_thread`
wrapper] re-appears" on a search-side hot path.

Hot paths = the per-request work inside route handlers in
search/routers/*.py. Excluded from the check:
  - Test code
  - The lazy_index_cache wrapper itself (intentional threading)
  - Background tasks in lifespan (search/app.py)

The test counts the per-route to_thread calls and asserts the
count is at or below the current baseline. A new to_thread on a
per-request hot path that already has one is a budget violation;
a new to_thread in a previously-zero-count route is an even
bigger violation.

# table. The point of the table is to surface the regression at
# review time, not to forbid the pattern outright.
