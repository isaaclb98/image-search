"""Round‑30: tests that the indexer persists source dimensions
into both the qdrant payload and the local SQLite cache.

Photo page's `formatDimensions()` reads from the qdrant payload
(or, in the cache path, the SQLite `images` table). Before this
round the indexer never wrote dims, so the page showed "—" for
every photo.

After the fix:
- `indexer.upsert.build_payload` accepts optional `width` /
  `height` keyword args and includes them in the returned dict.
- `indexer.image_loader.load` returns `(letterboxed_img,
  source_w, source_h)` so the pipeline can pass the source dims
  through without re-reading the file.
- `search.index_db.upsert_records` persists the dims in the
  `images` SQLite table.
