"""
tests/test_local_sync_backfill.py

Layer 1 — backfill mode (--reblurhash / --refingerprint) of local_sync.

The backfill walks an existing Qdrant collection and rewrites only
the requested payload field per point, reading the source file
from disk. No re-embedding; the 1536-dim vector stays untouched.

These tests guard:
  * --reblurhash and --refingerprint are mutually exclusive
  * Points with the right field already set are skipped (idempotent)
  * Points under a different `source` payload value are left alone
    (the Windows backfill should never rewrite other-machine points)
  * Missing-source-file paths are recorded as failed, not crashed on

The in-memory Qdrant client from the fixture is injected into
`local_sync.make_client` via monkeypatch so the test owns the same
Qdrant instance the CLI is reading from.
