"""
tests/test_local_sync_change_detection.py

Layer 1 tests for local_sync change detection (mtime/size-based re-embed).

Guards:
- unchanged files are skipped (no re-embed, no second point)
- files whose mtime/size changed are re-embedded INTO the same
  deterministic point id (favourites/album membership survives)
- legacy points without stored mtime/size are treated as changed,
  so they heal on the next sync
- dry-run reports what would be embedded without touching the collection
