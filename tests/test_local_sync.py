tests/test_local_sync.py

Layer 1 — blurhash and source-name presence in local_sync payloads.

`indexer.local_sync` is the new unified sync+embed CLI. It calls
`upsert.build_payload` for every photo, which already computes
blurhash + fingerprints. This test guards that contract so a future
refactor of build_payload can't silently drop blurhash (the client
side uses it for instant placeholders during image load — dropping
it would cause a visible UX regression).
