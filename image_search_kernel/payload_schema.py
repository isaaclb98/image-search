"""
image_search_kernel.payload_schema

Canonical Qdrant point payload schema. Single source of truth for
every field name and type stored on a Qdrant point.

Moved from `indexer/schema.py` so that both `search/` and `indexer/`
import the same constants. The `Payload` TypedDict lives here; the
writer (`indexer/upsert.py:build_payload`) and the readers (`search/*`)
both import from here, so a typo in one place can't silently break the
other side.

Adding a field:
  1. Add the constant below.
  2. Extend `Payload` TypedDict with the matching key/type.
  3. Update `SCHEMA.md` (the prose mirror at the repo root).
  4. If readers need it, add the constant import to the consumer.

Renaming or removing a field is a breaking change to the on-disk
collection — drop the collection and reindex.
