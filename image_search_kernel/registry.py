"""
image_search_kernel.registry

The model registry. The only place in the codebase that knows a
model's name, dim, resolution, revision, or how to embed with it.

Rules (from docs/backend-refactor-plan.md §4.3):

- No file outside this module references a model's dim, resolution,
  arch tag, revision, or call site.
- Every embedder call site in the codebase goes through
  `registry.get(name).text.embed_text(...)` or
  `registry.get(name).vision.embed_image(...)`. No direct
  `VisionEncoder(...)`, no `text_encoder.get_encoder()`, no
  `open_clip.create_model_and_transforms(...)` outside this module.
- Adding a model is a registry entry plus a config flag, nothing else.
- Removing a model is a registry deletion plus a check that no
  collection in any environment still references it.
- Real-model registrations are conditionally imported. The kernel
  package itself is importable on a CPU-only host with no torch /
  open_clip / transformers installed.

Concrete entries shipped today:

- `ViT-gopt-16-SigLIP2-384` — the web backend's current model
  (PyTorch + open_clip). Real registration is conditional.
- `mock-1536` — deterministic mock for tests and benchmarks. No
  real-model dependencies; safe to import on any host.
- `ViT-L-16-SigLIP2-256` — desktop product's model. Real
  registration is conditional; lives behind the same gate as the
  web's gopt entry.
