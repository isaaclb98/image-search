indexer/upsert.py

Qdrant writes. Idempotent by design.

The id strategy is: `sha1(f"{shard}::{path.as_posix()}").hexdigest()[:32]`.
This means:
  - Re-running the indexer on the same folder produces the same ids
    (Qdrant skips on duplicate).
  - Different shards can hold the same path (different ids).
  - The 32-char prefix is plenty for collision-resistance over
    realistic collection sizes (< 1B points).

# Vector dim of the active embedding model. Deprecated as a literal
# constant: pre-migration this was hardcoded to 1536 (gopt's dim);
# post-migration it tracks whatever model is configured
# (so400m/16-384 = 1152 today). Kept exported for backward
# compatibility with existing call sites that haven't been
# migrated to call `registry.get(name).dim` directly.
#
# Implementation: module-level `__getattr__` (PEP 562) resolves
# the dim on first access and caches it back into the module
# namespace so subsequent reads hit a plain int — no proxy, no
# `__int__` hack, no list-multiplication surprises.
#
# The PEP 562 hook fires for `from indexer.upsert import VECTOR_DIM`
# too — Python's import machinery looks up `VECTOR_DIM` on the
# module (which finds it via `__getattr__`), then binds it as a
# regular attribute in the importer's namespace. So the test
# `from indexer.upsert import VECTOR_DIM` resolves correctly.
#
# Lazy lookup means `indexer.upsert` can be imported in any
# context (test, prod, CLI) without forcing the registry to
# load real-model weights. Tests that mock-embed work because
# the registry patches the mock spec's dim before any caller
# reads VECTOR_DIM.

    three extra disk reads + a JPEG decode per point
    (`path.stat()` + `compute_blurhash()` + `compute_fingerprints()`,

    faster once the pipeline started reusing the loaded image.
