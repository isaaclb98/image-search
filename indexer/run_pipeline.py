"""
indexer/run_pipeline.py — thin library wrapper around IndexerPipeline.

`local_sync.py` is a feature-rich CLI with change-detection, prune,
and backfill modes that predate the pipeline abstraction. Those
features will migrate to the pipeline as separate phases in
follow-on PRs.

This module exposes the simplest possible "full sync one source via
the pipeline" entry point — no change detection, no prune, no
backfill. It's the right shape for the desktop app's "Index this
folder" action, where there's nothing to diff against.

Caller contract:
  - `source` must be a directory of images the indexer knows how to
    embed (see `indexer.scan:IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`).
  - `qdrant_client` must be an open connection. The caller owns its
    lifecycle.
  - `model_name` must be registered in `image_search_kernel.registry`.
    Defaults to the web backend's current model.
  - `dry_run=True` runs the full pipeline without writing to Qdrant.
    Returns the report's counts unchanged.

Returns a `PipelineReport` (from `indexer.pipeline`).

This module does NOT touch the existing `local_sync.main()` code
path. Both can coexist; `main()` continues to handle change-detection
and the other modes that the pipeline doesn't yet support.
