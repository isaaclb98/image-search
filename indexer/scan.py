indexer/scan.py

Folder walking for the indexer.

Critical invariant: we return a list (snapshot), not a generator.
On Windows/NTFS and SMB mounts, `os.scandir` re-yields renamed files
mid-iteration — see the lesson in
~/.openclaw/workspace-task/memory/self-improving/2026-06-04-find-images-snapshot.md

The indexer renames/mutates (writes sidecars, etc.) — so we must
materialize the file set BEFORE any iteration that could trigger
mid-walk renames. Snapshot, then iterate.

Speed: uses `os.scandir` directly and filters on DirEntry attributes
(is_file, name, suffix) — no `Path.is_file()` per file, which would be
a redundant `os.stat` syscall. On a Windows + SMB mount, the naive
`Path.rglob` + `Path.is_file()` approach is ~2x slower because of the
extra stat call per file.

Cooperative cancel (round 31): `snapshot()` accepts a `should_cancel`
callback that's polled every `cancel_check_every` files. On True,
the walk aborts with `ScanCancelled`. local_sync wires this to its
SIGTERM-driven `_is_cancelled()` so cancel is responsive even during
the filesystem walk — important for million-file libraries where the
walk alone takes minutes.

    `progress_every` controls how often a progress line is logged

    estimate of the total image count (e.g. from Qdrant's per-source
    count) used to print a time-to-completion estimate alongside the

    backwards compatible with all existing callers).
