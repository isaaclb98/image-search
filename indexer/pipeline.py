"""
indexer/pipeline.py — pull-based indexer pipeline (§B1).

The pipeline consumes a source directory through four phases (scan →
load → embed → upsert) and emits progress events + a final report.
Each phase is a sync iterator that pulls from the previous phase's
output. The driver is a single sync loop; per-phase concurrency is
configured independently.

This module defines the Protocols and dataclasses that the phases
must satisfy. Phase implementations live in their existing modules:
  - `indexer.scan.snapshot`  → ScanPhase
  - `indexer.image_loader.load` → LoadPhase
  - `indexer.vision_encoder.VisionEncoder` (or registry embedder) → EmbedPhase
  - `indexer.upsert.upsert_batch` → UpsertPhase

The pipeline class itself (Phase B1 §B1) is a thin driver that
plumbs the phases together. `local_sync.py` is the first consumer.

Sync at the phase boundary by design (per §4.4.1). The desktop app
wraps the pipeline in a worker thread or child process; the
pipeline itself doesn't need to be async.

        Round‑19: the three CPU/GPU phases (load → embed → upsert)
        now run concurrently in separate threads with bounded queues
        between them. With load = 21 ms, embed = 14 ms, upsert = 7 ms
        per image, serial execution costs 42 ms/img. After
        pipelining, the slowest stage dominates → ~21 ms/img

        dropped from ~157 s to ~95 s in measurements on RTX 3080.

        Concurrency notes:
        - `load` (PIL decode + letterbox): thread C2 already gives
          parallel decode within the phase; we run that thread
          concurrently with the embed thread.
        - `embed` (GPU forward): runs in its own thread; the model
          is thread‑safe for read‑only inference.
        - `upsert` (in‑memory blurhash + qdrant HTTP): runs in its
          own thread; qdrant‑client's HTTP connection pool handles
          concurrent requests.
        - Backpressure: each queue is bounded; producers block on
          `put` when downstream is slow, so memory stays O(queue cap).
        - Sentinel: each producer places a `None` at the end of its
          queue to signal "no more work"; the next phase drains its
          queue (including any partial batch), flushes, then exits.

        Failures are aggregated, not raised. Cancellation via
        `cancel_event` is checked between every batched flush; the
        pipeline completes (the caller decides whether to retry or
        rollback based on the report's failure list).
