"""
indexer/sync_meta.py — shim for the legacy sync_meta module.

The pre-Option-B design kept three Qdrant collections in play:
`images` (the search-side corpus), `images_pending` (the indexer's
write-side staging area), and `_sync_meta` (the SyncManager's
drift-detection marker point). The `--qdrant-collection` flag was
ambiguous between them, which is how the change-detection bug
(see commit 75aa9bb) crept in: every walk classified every file as
new because the indexer was reading from the staging area, not
the canonical one.

Option B drops the staging area entirely. The indexer writes
directly to `images`; the SyncManager is gone; `_sync_meta` and
`_pending` are no longer created or read. This module is kept as
a thin shim so existing test fixtures (`ensure_sync_collections`)
still import — the body just delegates to `upsert.ensure_collection`,
which is the single-collection primitive.

Anything that used to read or write `META_COLLECTION`,
`META_POINT_ID`, or `PENDING_COLLECTION` should be deleted, not
ported. They were only meaningful inside the sync loop.
