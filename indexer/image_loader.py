"""
indexer/image_loader.py

Load + preprocess an image for embedding.

Pipeline:
  1. PIL.Image.open(path) — lazy decode
  2. ImageOps.exif_transpose() — apply EXIF orientation
  3. .convert("RGB") — drop alpha; SigLIP2 expects 3 channels
  4. Letterbox resize to the registered model's resolution (e.g.
     384x384 for ViT-gopt-16-SigLIP2-384, 256x256 for
     ViT-L-16-SigLIP2-256) — preserve aspect ratio
  5. Normalize with the model's mean/std — produces a tensor
     ready for the embedder

The model's resolution, mean, and std are pulled from the
kernel's model registry by `model_name`. No constants live in
this module.
