indexer/thumbnails.py — generate WebP thumbnails at index time.

Thumbnails are 384×384 max dimension, WebP q80 4:4:4. Storage
layout: {THUMBNAIL_DIR}/{prefix}/{point_id}.webp

Two-level prefix (first 2 chars of point_id) avoids putting 2M files
in one directory. ~8K files per bucket at 2M scale.

Post the model-variant migration plan: the thumbnail is the same
resolution as the so400m model input (384×384). The embedder still
loads the original JPEG directly — see `image_loader.py`'s
`_resize_for_embedding` — but indexing now writes a single 384px
display asset. The canonical 256px file is no longer written; the
sized-variant tuple is empty.

Why a single 384px variant (vs. the pre-migration 240/180/120 trio):
the model's input resolution is 384, and 384px is enough to render
crisp up to 192 CSS pixels at 2× DPR — covers most desktop + tablet
tile sizes. The pre-migration 240 was already too small to be
sharp at 192 CSS px × 2× DPR; 480 would be overkill for the common
rendering path and waste storage. Single-variant keeps the on-disk
footprint manageable and lets the frontend use a single hardcoded
`?w=384` request without consulting a srcset.

Why 384 and not a new 240/360/480 trio: the storage win is real
(~22 GB → ~20 GB on a 902k corpus) and the rendering win is
neutral (the new 384px is sharp where the old 240 was blurry).
