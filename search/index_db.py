        Idempotent across re-opens via a `schema_meta` flag
        (`fts_v1`). On a legacy / partial DB (images has rows,
        FTS is empty or under-populated), backfill FTS by
        copying `(rowid, path)` from `images` into
        `images_fts` — the AI/AU/AD triggers handle
        steady-state sync from here on.

        Designed to be cheap to call on every open:

          * Already-migrated DB → one-row lookup, return.
          * Fresh DB (no `images` rows yet) → mark done, return.
          * In sync (FTS rowcount ≥ images rowcount) → mark
            done, return.
          * Legacy / partial → DELETE FROM images_fts,
            backfill from `images`, mark done.

        The backfill is non-destructive: we never touch the
        `images` table, so test fixtures that seed SQLite
        directly to bypass Qdrant still see their data on the
        next read. The previous implementation called
        `init_from_qdrant(force=True)` for the legacy case,
        which is correct for production (Qdrant has the
        authoritative data) but wipes test fixtures (Qdrant is
        empty in those tests). The backfill is the right call
        in both cases: production images are already in sync
        with Qdrant (the FTS gets populated from those rows);
        fixture images are preserved (FTS gets populated from
        those rows). Operators who need a full rebuild from
        Qdrant (e.g. to recover from divergent state) can use
        `POST /api/cache/refresh`, which still calls
        `init_from_qdrant(force=True)` on demand.

        Returns `None` when the pattern is empty / whitespace-only —
        the caller is expected to skip the filter in that case so we
        don't pay the FTS5 round-trip on every request. Otherwise
        returns the list of image ids whose `path` matches the
        pattern under the FTS5 token-substring / prefix rules:

          * `chaewon`  → token-substring match. FTS5 splits the path
            into tokens on `/`, `-`, `_`, `.` etc, and matches each
            token as a substring. So `/photos/kpop/chaewon/2024.jpg`
            tokenises to [photos, kpop, chaewon, 2024, jpg] and any
            single-token query (e.g. `chaewon`, `kpop`, `2024`)
            hits. The match is anchored to token boundaries — `won`
            does NOT match `chaewon` (substring but not token-aligned).
          * `chaewon*` → token-prefix match. `won*` would NOT match
            `chaewon` (token prefix, not substring prefix).

        Anything else (notably `*ewon` or `*.jpg`) raises a
        ValueError so the caller surfaces a 400 with a clear error.
        The fnmatch-style suffix / bracket / question-mark syntax is
        intentionally NOT supported — FTS5 has no native equivalent,
        and silently no-op'ing would confuse users into thinking the
        filter is broken. Callers can either drop the leading `*`
        (becomes a token match) or use a plain substring via the
        implicit token-substring semantics above.

        The matching itself is case-insensitive (FTS5 default with
        unicode61), and diacritics are folded (remove_diacritics=2
        tokenizer option).

        Performance: FTS5 with content='images' is fast — typically
        sub-10ms for tens of thousands of matching rows on the
        live 1.5M cache. The caller should still apply the
        cardinality guard (see app.py) before passing the result to
        Qdrant, since `HasId` with >50% of the collection is
        strictly worse than no filter at all.
