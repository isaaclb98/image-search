"""
search/routers/thumbnails.py — thumbnail serving endpoint.

Serves pre-generated WebP thumbnails from THUMBNAIL_DIR.
Falls back to 404 if thumbnail doesn't exist (frontend uses blurhash).

Path pattern: {THUMBNAIL_DIR}/{prefix}/{point_id}.webp
  - prefix = first 2 chars of point_id (256 buckets)
  - ~8KB per image at 256px WebP q50

Round-perf (issue #2): supports an optional ?w= query param so the
frontend can ask for a sized variant for its srcset. Returns 404 if
the sized variant doesn't exist on disk so the browser falls back to
the canonical 256px file (which is always present).
