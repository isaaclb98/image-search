"""
search/centroids.py — load and serve custom centroid vectors.

A centroid is a precomputed embedding (typically a taste mean) saved
to disk by `isaac-image-scoring` as a torch .pt file with this shape:

    torch.save({
        "centroid":     Tensor[FEATURE_DIM],  # unit-norm
        "name":         str,
        "model":        str,                  # e.g. "siglip2"
        "model_type":   str,                  # e.g. "siglip2", "ensemble", "dinov3"
        "model_id":     str | None,
        "feature_dim":  int,
        "n_images":     int,
        "extracted_at": iso-8601 str,
    }, path)

The search side reads these once at startup and exposes them as a
read-only in-memory store keyed by name. There is no write path on
the search side — centroids are owned by `isaac-image-scoring`. The
search app is just a consumer.

**Model/dim guard.** Every centroid must come from the same embedding
space as the indexed images, otherwise Qdrant cosine search returns
nonsense (1536-dim centroid vs. 4096-dim dino v3 collection, etc.). A
centroid whose `model`/`model_type` or `feature_dim` does not match
the configured `expected_model` is skipped at load time and logged
with a clear warning. The store never serves a mismatched centroid
and the routes 404 on lookup, but the user can still see *that* it
exists in the directory via the file path (handy for debugging).

# Multi-centroid blending
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Some queries benefit from a centroid that lives "between" two or
# more existing centroids — e.g. 70% wuxia + 30% portrait. We
# implement that as a weighted mean of the input vectors,
# re-normalised to unit length, gated by a model/dim check so a
# user can't accidentally average across embedding spaces and
# produce nonsense scores.
#
# The function is pure (no I/O), so it lives next to the centroid
# types rather than on CentroidStore. The route layer fetches each
# centroid vector, hands them to this helper, and ships the result
# to Qdrant as a single query vector.


    # blend_centroids + composite_centroid_name live in search/centroids_compute.py (§B3 step 43).



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dynamic centroids
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A dynamic centroid is computed at runtime from application state
# rather than loaded from disk. The v1 use case is "favourites": the
# mean of every favourited photo's embedding, re-normalised to unit
# length. The compute function is supplied at registration time and
# the registry caches its last result so subsequent reads are O(1).
#
# Lifecycle:
#   - Registered once at app startup (one call per centroid).
#   - Computed lazily on first read.
#   - Invalidated by `mark_favorite` / `unmark_favorite` (or any
#     other code path that mutates the underlying state). The next
#     read triggers a recompute.
#
# Why a separate registry instead of extending CentroidStore:
#   - CentroidStore's contract is immutable post-load. Dynamic
#     centroids are mutable, so conflating them risks accidental
#     reloads wiping a dynamic centroid or vice versa.
#   - Static and dynamic centroids have different metadata shapes
#     (no model/dim guard for dynamic; the compute fn owns that).
#     Keeping them apart keeps each spec lean.
#   - The dynamic registry can grow later to host per-theme or
#     per-window centroids without touching static loading at all.

# Near-duplicate rejection for dynamic-centroid search
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When a user searches with a dynamic centroid (mean of favourites
# or album members), the top results shouldn't echo the seed
# photos themselves — not just exact id matches, but vector-near
# copies (re-encodes, crops, recompressions, recolors) that share
# an embedding with a seed. The two-layer approach lives in
# search/app.py:
#
#   Layer 1 — exact-id `must_not` filter at Qdrant (cheap).
#   Layer 2 — numpy post-pass on the candidate set that drops
#             anything within the seed cluster.
#
# This module owns the pure pieces of Layer 2: the threshold
# calibration (`calibrate_near_dup_threshold`) and the rejection
# (`filter_near_duplicates`). Both are numpy-only and dependency
# free so they're unit-testable without Qdrant or the FastAPI
# app. The route in app.py fetches the seed vectors, builds the
# numpy matrix, and hands it to these helpers.


    # calibrate_near_dup_threshold + filter_near_duplicates live in search/centroids_compute.py (§B3 step 43).
