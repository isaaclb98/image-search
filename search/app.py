        Translate a raw `?filename=` pattern to an `allowed_ids` list
        for Qdrant's `HasId` filter, applying the cardinality guard.

          (None, None)            — no filter requested (pattern
                                    was empty), OR the guard decided
                                    to skip the filter because

                                    the cache. Caller passes `None`
                                    to qdrant.search meaning "no
                                    HasId filter".
          ([], None)              — pattern matched zero images.
                                    Caller surfaces an empty result
                                    (the user typed
                                    `?filename=nonsense`).
          (list[str], None)       — a usable set of allowed ids.
          (None, "bad_request")   — pattern was syntactically
                                    invalid (caller surfaces a 400
                                    with the validator's message
                                    via `path_token_ids`).

        The cardinality guard is the load-bearing piece: when a
        pattern like `2024` matches 60% of the collection, applying
        `HasId` to the rest actively hurts search quality (HNSW
        has to pick the top-K from a non-uniform distribution AND
        serialise the id list on every request) without meaningfully
        narrowing anything. By dropping the filter above the guard
        threshold we get "full ranking + 0 wasted work", which is
        the right default for very-broad queries.

        The guard uses the SQLite cache rowcount as the denominator
        — it's already loaded and O(1) to read. For the 1.5M-row
        live cache that's a free comparison.

        Total count is fetched via `await asyncio.to_thread` so it
        doesn't block the event loop on the (cheap) SQLite read.
