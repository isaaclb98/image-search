                       cache_key_extra="") -> list[str]
        Materialise the top `top_pct`% of library by relevance-to-taste,
        uniformly shuffled. Cached for `_FOR_YOU_TTL_SECONDS` keyed by
        (fav_ids, dis_ids, top_pct, cache_key_extra); invalidated by
        invalidate_for_you_cache().

    rank_for_you(..., limit=30, page=0, seed=None) -> tuple[list, int, bool]
        Slice `limit` ids from `page * limit` of the shuffled pool,
        fetch their payloads via qdrant.retrieve_batch, return
        (hits, total, has_more). Pass a fresh `seed` on each page
        reload for a fresh shuffle; reuse the same `seed` for
        paginated scroll calls within a single page-mount to walk
        forward through the same shuffle coherently.

    invalidate_for_you_cache() -> None
        Drop the cache. Called from the favorites/dislikes routes
        whenever the user changes their feedback so the next
        /api/for-you/feed request sees fresh ranking signal.

Design notes
------------
The pool is built once per (fav_ids, dis_ids, top_pct, seed) tuple
via qdrant.recommend(positive=fav, negative=dis, limit=pool_size) and
then uniform-random shuffled. The "top top_pct%" semantic is
approximate: it is whatever Qdrant returns for the top-`pool_size`
candidates by recommend() score. This is the fast path (1-3s on
800k library). A separate, slower precomputed-score path is a
future concern.

Cold start (no favorites yet) falls back to a zero-vector search
because Qdrant recommend() requires non-empty positives. The result
degrades to /random-equivalent behaviour for fresh users — see the
zero-vector search() branch below for the same shape.
