search/image_resolver.py

Maps a Qdrant payload `path` to something the web UI can serve.

The NAS paths in Qdrant payloads are absolute source paths. The
container cannot serve arbitrary file paths. We expose images
through the `/photo/{id}/raw` route instead, so the resolver's
job is to map (id, payload_path) to that URL.

    Map a payload's stored path to a local file path on this machine.
