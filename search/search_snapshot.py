"""
search/search_snapshot.py — stable pagination for /api/search.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Qdrant offset pagination is unsound on HNSW. To return a page at
`offset` the engine must internally rank `offset + limit` candidates,
and the graph-search breadth scales with that depth. Two pages of the
same query are therefore ranked at *different depths* and disagree
near their boundary:

    offset=240 limit=24   ranks at depth 264
    offset=288 limit=24   ranks at depth 312
    -> 20 of 24 ids overlap

Measured on prod (2,052,334 points, Qdrant 1.19.0), a page walk to
offset 480 returned 78 duplicate ids across 504 results — with the
indexer completely idle. This is not collection mutation; it is
depth drift. Each request is individually correct, the pages simply
do not align.

THE FIX
-------
Rank once, at one fixed depth, and slice every page out of that
frozen list. Offset then indexes a stable snapshot instead of a
live HNSW walk, so pages are disjoint by construction.

Depth is grown incrementally rather than fixed up front, because a
single deep fetch is expensive on page 1 (depth 5000 = 179ms warm,
depth 10000 = 473ms) while a band fetch stays cheap and its cost
grows only with the exclusion set:

    excluded 0      ->  9.1ms
    excluded 1000   -> 12.0ms
    excluded 5000   -> 20.8ms
    excluded 10000  -> 33.1ms   (361KB request body)

A band of 500 is amortised over ~20 pages of 24, so even at 10k
deep a page costs ~1.6ms of band fetch plus ~2.2ms to hydrate
payloads. Page 1 stays ~10ms at any collection size.

Exclusion is a server-side `must_not HasIdCondition`, verified to
return zero overlap even with 10000 ids excluded.

DELIBERATELY NOT the diversity cache
------------------------------------
`DiversityResultCache` stores a `DiversityStats` alongside its hits
because it caches an MMR re-ranking. Plain search does no re-ranking,
so reusing that type would mean fabricating stats and recoupling two
independent features. This is a separate, smaller cache holding only
an ordered `(id, score)` list.

WHAT IS AND ISN'T GUARANTEED
----------------------------
Guaranteed: zero overlap between pages of one query.
Approximate: ordering *across* a band boundary. Band 2 is "the top
500 of what remains", not a perfect continuation of one global
ranking — HNSW cannot guarantee that. Given the flat score tail
(rank 2000 = 0.7798, rank 10000 = 0.7481) the reordering is
invisible.

Staleness: a snapshot is frozen for `ttl_seconds`. Photos indexed
mid-session don't appear until the entry expires. That is the price
of stability — a frozen page order and a live collection cannot both
hold. Same trade-off the diversity path already makes.
