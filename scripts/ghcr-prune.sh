#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/ghcr-prune.sh — one-time cleanup to reclaim GHCR storage.
#
# Why this script exists:
#   image-build.yml pushed a :latest + :sha-<7> on every successful
#   build. After ~60 successful builds the free 0.5 GB tier is full.
#   The prune step in image-build.yml keeps the 5 newest :sha-* tags
#   going forward; this script does the same retroactive cleanup.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Run this script: `bash scripts/ghcr-prune.sh`
#   2. `gh auth refresh -s delete:packages` when prompted — this
#      grants the scope to the existing gh CLI token so the script
#      can list + delete container versions.
#   3. Re-run `gh auth refresh -d delete:packages` afterwards to
#      drop the scope back to least-privilege (your token currently
#      has: gist, read:org, repo, workflow).
#
# Safe to run repeatedly; idempotent.
#
# Output is dry-run by default. Pass `--apply` to actually delete.
