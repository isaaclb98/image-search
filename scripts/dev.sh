# scripts/dev.sh — wrapper for the dev stack at ~/docker/image-search-dev/.
#
# Why this exists (rather than calling docker compose directly):
#   - The dev stack uses different container names, volumes, and
#     ports from prod. The point of that is isolation. But a stray
#     `docker compose down` in the wrong directory, or a copy-paste
#     error in a script, could still target prod. This wrapper
#     refuses to run from anywhere except ~/docker/image-search-dev/
#     and refuses to invoke docker compose against any project that
#     isn't `image-search-dev`.
#   - The agent (me) has been told "don't touch prod" many times and
#     has gotten it wrong before. Mechanical guards > discipline.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev.sh up       # docker compose up -d --build
#   scripts/dev.sh down     # docker compose down (keeps volumes)
#   scripts/dev.sh reset    # docker compose down -v (wipes dev data)
#   scripts/dev.sh logs     # docker compose logs -f (both services)
#   scripts/dev.sh status   # docker compose ps
#   scripts/dev.sh shell    # docker compose exec search /bin/bash
#
# Anything else: prints usage.

# the user can run docker directly (no sg needed), this still
# works — `sg -c "cmd"` is a no-op wrapper when the user already
